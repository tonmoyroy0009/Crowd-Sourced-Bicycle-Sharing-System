# Crowd-Sourced-Bicycle-Sharing-System
The growing population in the smart city demands an efficient transportation sharing which is bicycle sharing system for developing the smart city. The Bicycle sharing as we know is affordable, easily accessible and reliable mode of transportation. But an efficient bicycle sharing capable of not only sharing bike also provides information regarding the availability of bicycle per station, route business, time/day-wise bicycle schedule. The embedded sensors are able to opportunistically communicate through wireless communication with stations when available, providing real-time data about tours/minutes, speed, effort, rhythm, etc. We have been based on our study analysis data to predict regarding the bicycleâ€™s available at stations, bicycle schedule, a location of the nearest hub where a bike is available etc., reduce the user time and effort.
